# SublimeScold

What is SublimeScold? It's this:

![Show HN - vim-WTF A vim plugin that sends a shaming email to the developer responsible for the highlighted line of code](vim-wtf.png)

but for Sublime Text. Works with Git as version control.


## Steps to reproduce

1. Notice a piece of code that misses your expectations.
2. Select it, right-click and choose "Scold".
3. Adjust the e-mail as you see fit.
4. Send it.
5. ???
6. Profit!


## Will ~~not~~ maybe fix

* Support other version control systems
* Modify e-mail subject & template body in plugin settings
